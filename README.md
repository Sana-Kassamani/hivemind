> A mobile application for smart beehive management, assisting beekeepers in monitoring hive health and improving honey harvest.
>
> HiveMind tracks hive conditions with real-time monitoring via IoT devices. It provides AI insights on harvest timing, pest infestations, and weather conditions. Ultimately, it streamlines collaboration between hive owners and beekeepers.

### User Stories

#### Owner

- As an owner, I want to check my apiaries and hives and their location, so I can keep track of their conditions.
- As an owner, I want to receive recommendations on hive activities, so I can ensure maximum harvest.
- As an owner, I want to assign tasks to beekeepers, so I can make sure the work gets done on time.

#### Beekeeper

- As a beekeeper, I want to receive hive conditions from sensors and manually add some, so I can track the hives health.
- As a beekeeper, I want to upload hive pictures and audios, so I can monitor pests or abnormal activity.
- As a beekeeper, I want to receive tasks from the owner and mark them as done, so I can keep the owner updated on my progress.

#### Admin

- As an admin, I want to track all users and their activity, so I can ensure app is used appropriately.
- As an admin, I want to manage user accounts, so I can add, update, or deactivate users as needed.
- As an admin, I want to view and edit details of all apiaries and hives, so I can maintain accurate records of the hives and their conditions.

<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title3.svg"/>

### Coffee Express is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
